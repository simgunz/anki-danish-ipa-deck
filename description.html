This anki deck is based on the language learning method presented by Gabriel Wyner on fluent-forever.com and aims to teach you all the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) symbols of the Italian language. Differently from the [English IPA deck](https://fluent-forever.com/ipa-anki-deck/) provided by Gabriel Wyner this one doesn't contains the phonetic articulations cards and contains all the allophones of a single phoneme. Because of this it's important you know the difference between phone and phoneme.

Before using this deck I recommend to watch the <a href="https://fluent-forever.com/chapter3/">pronunciation video tutorial</a> hosted on fluent-forever.com and to read the following Wikipedia articles (at least the abstract).

The cards tagged 'allophone' may be suspended in a first moment since they can considered an advanced topic.

The term between parenthesis () specifies better the articulatory feature.

The term between brackets [] is a common alternative name of the articulatory feature.
